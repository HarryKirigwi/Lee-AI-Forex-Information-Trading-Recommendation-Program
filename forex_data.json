    "justification": "** The EUR/USD is in a clear downward trend, confirmed by a lower high and lower low structure. The price is trading below both the 20-EMA (1.16080) and 50-EMA (1.16119), indicating bearish momentum. A recent liquidity sweep occurred above the period high of 1.16347, suggesting smart money may have targeted stop-losses before resuming the downward trend. On the fundamental side, while the Eurozone CPI Flash Estimate exceeded expectations (2.6% vs. 2.5%), the market appears to be favoring USD strength due to the anticipation of a potentially hawkish Fed tone in the upcoming speech by the Federal Reserve Chair. The sell entry targets the fair value gap (FVG) near 1.15900, aligning with institutional order flow and liquidity objectives."
